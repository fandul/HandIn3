1. Explain generally , what is meant by a NoSQL Database.
    NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide better performance compared to Relational Databases.
    As the name suggests it does not use SQL queries. It is more popular in big data and real-time web applications.
    It is very flexible and schema-less data model.

2. Explain Pros & Cons of using No SQL.

    Pros                                                                        Cons
    * are more scalable and provide superior performance        * has less support then RDBMS
    * can handle Big data better than RDBMS                     * requires lot of skill to install and effort to maintain
    * cheaper than RDBMS                                        * Expertise: more RDMBS experts then NoSQl
    * has more flexible data models                             * relatively new compared to RDBMS

3. Explain how databases like MongoDB and redis would be classified in the NoSQL world.

4. Explain the reasons to add a layer like mongoose to MongoDB.

5. Explain using examples, the strategy for querying MongoDB(CRUD operations).

6. Demonstrate, using a REST-API, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB.

7. Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and provide an example involving all CRUD operations

8. Explain how redis "fits" into the NoSQL world, and provide an example of how to use it.

9. Explain, using a relevant example, how redis (or a similar) can increase scalability (drastic) for a server using
   server side sessions

10.Explain, using a relevant example, a full MEAN application including relevant test cases to test the REST-API
   (not on the production database)
